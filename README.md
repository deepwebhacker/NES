# NES
Nirex Encryption Standard (Might Be Removed)

A custom encryption standard made entirely in standard C++

Documentation may come soon.

# THE WHY AND HOW OF IT

This encryption method is made up of patterns, keychains, keypattenrs, time variable, mixers and most importantly pipelines.
Each of the elements mentioned above plays a major role in the encryption/decryption of what you give it.
