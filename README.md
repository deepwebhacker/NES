# NES
Nirex Encryption Standard

A custom encryption standard made entirely in standard C++

Documentation may come soon.

# WHY

NES has a couple of encryptions pipelines that can go forward and back (At least that's how I call them).

Let's call those methods A, B and C

If you go forward in 'A' and then backward in 'A' you'll basically get the same data.

So each Pipeline's Forward method, counteracts the Backward method, (And vice versa).
Now since we have 2 more Encryption pipelines, you can move around in this grid of methods 
and pipelines with a pattern file to make an extreme case of data encryption algorithm.
